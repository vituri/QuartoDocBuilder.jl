# Deploy to GitHub Pages

This guide shows how to automatically deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages.

## Generate GitHub Actions Workflow

QuartoDocBuilder can generate a GitHub Actions workflow for you:

```julia
using QuartoDocBuilder
quarto_github_action()
```

This creates `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`.

## Workflow Contents

The generated workflow:

1. Triggers on pushes to `main` branch
2. Installs Julia and Quarto
3. Builds documentation
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

```yaml
name: Documentation
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1
      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Build documentation
        run: |
          julia --project=docs -e '
            using Pkg
            Pkg.develop(path=".")
            Pkg.instantiate()
            include("docs/make.jl")
          '
          cd docs && quarto render

      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: docs/site

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

## Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Click **Pages** in the sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions**
4. Push to `main` to trigger the first build

## Custom Domain

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to `docs/` with your domain
2. Configure DNS records for your domain
3. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

Check the Actions log for errors. Common issues:

- Missing dependencies in `docs/Project.toml`
- Quarto rendering errors
- Julia compilation errors

### Pages Not Updating

- Ensure the workflow completed successfully
- Check that `docs/site/` is being uploaded
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub to deploy

### 404 Errors

- Verify `output_dir = "site"` in your config
- Check that `_quarto.yml` is generated correctly
