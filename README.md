# QuartoDocBuilder.jl

QuartoDocBuilder.jl is a package inspired by R [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). It provides an easy way to generate a website with documentation and vignettes, by creating a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) project.

Being powered by Quarto means that deploying to Github pages, customizing the style and many more things are taken for granted.
